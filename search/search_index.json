By default, you can do this in Foundry by giving every player observer permissions, but in that case tokens will only share vision if the player has no tokens selected. Shared Vision allows you to configure actors so they will always share their vision, or only when you press a control button, or when it's triggered by Trigger Happy or Hey, Wait!</p> <p>Besides sharing the vision of all players tokens with all players, there are some player-specific options. An actor can be configured to always share its vision with specific players, it can also be configured to share its location with specific players (the token icon will be drawn over unexplored areas), or share its fog exploration with specific players.</p> <p>A control button allows you to easily toggle vision sharing for all players for specified actors (Global Shared Vision). The reasoning behind this is that, when dungeon delving, the player in the back of the marching order will miss out on all the awesome stuff that's happening at the front. The GM might have prepared an awesome cut-scene, with vivid descriptions, but the wizard at the back isn't in the same room yet as the fighter in the front, so the wizard's player is missing out on all the action! Shared Vision allows the GM to press a button, and the vision between specified tokens will be shared with all players, so everyone gets to enjoy the cool stuff at the front.</p>"},{"location":"#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>Tokens can share one or more of the different sharing options.</p> <p>You can either configure the sharing options on an actor-by-actor basis in the vision config, or configure the sharing options based on token ownership or disposition in the module settings.</p> <p>In the module settings you can also configure whether some sharing options should be enabled or disabled when combat starts or stops.</p> <p>There are control buttons that can be used to enable or disable some sharing options.</p> <p>Lastly, some Shared Vision settings can be enabled or disabled from other modules or hooks.</p>"},{"location":"#compatibility","title":"Compatibility","text":"<p>Foundry VTT: v9 - v12</p> <p>Module Combatibilities: Shared Vision overrides the default 'Token.prototype._isVisionSource' method while vision sharing is enabled.
