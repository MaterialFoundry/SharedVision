Shared vision offers 2 control buttons to the GM on the left side of the screen. Both buttons are located in the 'Token Controls'.

These control buttons can also be controlled from [other modules](otherModules.md), or they can be [automatically enabled or disabled when combat starts or stops](moduleSettings.md#combat).

## Global Shared Vision
The top control button (globe) toggles 'Global Shared Vision'. Enabling this shares the vision for all tokens with enabled 'Global Shared Vision' in the actor's [vision config](visionConfig.md).

This allows quick but temporary vision sharing between players, for example when one players enters an encounter while other players aren't nearby.

## Disable All Vision Sharing
The bottom control button (crossed out eye) toggles 'Disable All Vision Sharing'. With this button enabled, all vision sharing (originating from Shared Vision) is stopped.
